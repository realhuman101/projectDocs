# Project Documentation/Instructions
Documentation/instructions for all my personal projects.  *(Essentially anything that requires a markdown document for information)*  
  
Every project is separated into its own individual folder.

This is also used as a public issues tracker for private repositories.

## Models
There are some CAD models stored within this repository, namely the below:

- [Planetary Gears](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6731402)
