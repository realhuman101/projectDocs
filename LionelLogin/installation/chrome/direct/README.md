## Requirements
Please ensure you have the following:
- The [Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_hk/chrome/)

## Instructions
For a more visual representation of these steps, feel free to use [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VIXn9FJb83H6CQwr-JYIFJgz-z2UQoDg9Y4QCHWtGL0/edit#slide=id.g1187dfacd3e_0_20) as installation instructions.  
*Just note that those instructions are no longer being maintained, so there is a small possibility the instructions are no longer accurate*

### 1. Installation of Files
Open this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fdvf5XMKoZpoxU-0YezVKRM6Ve97YVmN?usp=sharing), and locate the folder of the version you would like to install. *(The version is written next to LionelLogin)*  
`Right-click` this folder and select `Download`. A `.zip`/compressed version of this folder will start installing onto your computer.  

### 2. Decompressing Files
Locate the newly installed file(s) on your machine, and proceed to unzip/decompress the files.  
> If you are unaware of how to do so, instructions for Windows 10 can be located [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-unzip-files-windows-10) and instructions for MacOS can be located [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac). **Please make sure to do so before proceeding with instructions**  

You will now have a **folder**, instead of a `.zip`/compressed file, named `LionelLogin v_._._` *(Based on installation)*
> *You may rename this file to your liking as it will not affect the installation process*

#### 2.5 Relocating Files 
> **THIS STEP IS ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** - You may complete this step if you have personal preference for the location of your files  

> It is suggested to relocate files before proceeding with the installation, to make the entire process easier.  

You may now relocate the uncompressed folder recently installed to a place of your liking, as long as you remember this location and are able to access it on your local machine. 

### 3. Setting up the Chrome extension manager
Open <a href="chrome://extensions/" target="_blank">this link</a> / `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome  
**OR**  
Press the extension icon on the top-right side of the window and select `Manage extensions`  
  
You have successfully opened the Chrome extension manager.  
  
Now make sure the developer mode switch *(on the top-right corner of the page)* is switched on, and a new tab should appear on the top of the page, showing the options `Load unpacked`, `Pack extension` and `Update`.

### 4. Uploading the extension to Chrome
Press the `Load unpacked` option, and `locate + select` the folder you installed earlier. A new extension would now be added, named LionelLogin. This means you have successfully installed the extension.
